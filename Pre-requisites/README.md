# Set up your Azure Account

### Setting up your Azure Account - follow the steps below
You may activate an Azure free trial at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/]("https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/").
If you have been given an Azure Pass to complete this lab, you may go to [http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/]("http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/") to activate it. Please follow the instructions at [https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto]("https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto"), which document the activation process. A Microsoft account may have one free trial on Azure and one Azure Pass associated with it, so if you have already activated an Azure Pass on your Microsoft account, you will need to use the free trial or use another Microsoft account.
